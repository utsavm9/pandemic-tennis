Pandemic Tennis is 3D single-player table tennis. Because it is hard to draw a mask in the game and the pandemic is still ongoing, the player will be playing alone, hitting the ball to a wall, trying to not miss it.

**Advanced features**:
* Collision detection: We utilize collision detection calculations to determine if the ball will bounce off of the paddle, backboard, and table.
* Physics: The ball maintains a constant acceleration and changing velocity to simulate real bouncing.
